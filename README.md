# E-commerce Back End

## Description

E-commerce is an ever-growing sector of the tech industry. This purpose of this project is to solidify my understanding of the fundamental backend architecture of e-commerce sites using relational database structures. I have built both the relational database tables to store data and APIs to fetch and return that data so that it could be used in a front end e-commerce website.
